    You will now practice the plate balancing game without the Attention Management System, which means that you decide yourself when to switch between plates and how to control them.
  </p>

  <p>
    During this practice phase you should use the gamepad to move between plates and to tilt the active plate, and you should focus on keeping the red balls on the plates for as long as possible. You can start a practice round by pressing <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> on the keyboard or the <strong>left trigger (L2)</strong> on the gamepad, and after a practice round ends you can restart or exit using the controls shown on the “Game Over” screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    These practice rounds are not part of the main data collection, and the experimenter will tell you when the practice is sufficient and when the study will move on to the main block without assistance.
